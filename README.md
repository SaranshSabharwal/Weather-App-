Plan your day with confidence using this sleek weather app! Built with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), it seamlessly integrates with the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather information for any city you choose.

Features at a Glance:

User-Friendly Interface: Enter your desired city name in a designated search bar. The app takes care of the rest, presenting the weather data in a clear and concise format.
Real-Time Updates: Leverage the power of OpenWeather API to access the latest weather conditions directly. No more relying on outdated forecasts!

Scalability: Designed with flexibility in mind, the app can be extended to display additional weather data points or integrate with other APIs for a more comprehensive weather experience.
Technical Considerations:

OpenWeather API Key: To utilize the OpenWeather API, you'll need to obtain a free API key from their website. This key is used to authenticate your application and allows access to weather data.
JavaScript Fetch API or Libraries: The app can leverage the built-in JavaScript Fetch API or utilize popular libraries like Axios to make requests to the OpenWeather API and retrieve weather data.
Data Parsing and Display: Once weather data is retrieved, JavaScript parses the response to extract relevant information and dynamically updates the HTML elements displaying the weather details on your webpage.
